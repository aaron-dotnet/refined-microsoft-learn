Make Microsoft Learn better by focusing on the main content.

This repository is a fork of [merill/refined-microsoft-learn](https://github.com/merill/refined-microsoft-learn) and maintained by **aaron-dotnet**. It targets Firefox and includes upkeep and configuration changes from the original project.

This extension gives you a cleaner, faster and more readable Microsoft Learn experience without the clutter.

- Removes the content on the right pane
- Expands the main content area so code samples and tables have more horizontal space

## What it does

- Reduce clutter by removing the right pane
- Fix table & code truncating issues by using the full width of the browser

Note: screenshots and store links were removed from this fork's README. See the source code in `src/` to inspect installation and behavior.
